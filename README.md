## P2P - Pull to Push
### What does this mean?
As the name suggests some api's need to send you the data instead you fetching them. That's what this project is about.
It converts a Pull Api to Push Api through some scheduling and a dashboard to manage your webhooks over time.


### But why
As a programmer pulling data through API's is a norm, you fetch some data and store it into the DB perform some business logic.
A lot of times this data is either time series data or something you want to monitor over time and that indicates pulling the data
constantly over an interval of time. 
So Instead of you setting up some schedulers and add complexity to your project I have a easy way for you.




### How do I register my webhooks?
Just go over to [P2P Homepage](p2p.ashweenmankash.in) with your CURLs and register them to the backend and you'll see your API getting the data you need.
